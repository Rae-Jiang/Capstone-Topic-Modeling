# Capstone: Latent Semantic Topic Distribution Discovery over Web Content Corpus
Topic models are widely applied to provide automated analysis of unclassified online web content in various business settings. This capstone project is collaborating with Bombora's Data Science team on discovering the underlying latent semantic topics distribution. The dataset consists of large Internet web browsing events which contains text content extracted from virtually all urls. Our project presented the results of applying different data preprocessing techniques for topic models and implementing and evaluating several topic models including Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), Hierarchical Dirichlet Process(HDP), Correlated Topic Modeling(CTM) and also a Variational autoencoder based model for comparison. In the end, we also evaluated the performance of all above stated models on 20NewsGroups, a human labeled benchmark dataset.
